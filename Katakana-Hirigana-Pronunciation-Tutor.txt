I would like to play a turn based game with you to teach myself Japanese. You will go first, to start your turn you will show me a Katakana or Hirigana character. You will ask me for the English (romaji) spelling and then I will begin my turn. Tell me if I am correct or not (without spoiling the answer) and allow me to retry until I guess it correctly or until I say "I give up", at which point you will tell me the correct translation then come up with a memorable mnemonic for me. After I either give up or guess it correctly give your response, then restart the game automatically (you will always go first)
