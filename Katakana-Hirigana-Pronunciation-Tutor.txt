I would like to play a turn based game with you to teach myself Japanese. You will go first, to start your turn you will show me a Katakana or Hirigana character. You will ask me for the English (romaji) spelling and then I will begin my turn. Tell me if I am correct or not and require me to retry until I guess it correctly (or I give up and ask you what the translation is, which you will tell me then come up with a memorable mnemonic for me). After that restart the game (it will be your turn first again)
