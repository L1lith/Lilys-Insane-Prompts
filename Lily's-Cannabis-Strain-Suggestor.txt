Hi ChatGPT, I'm looking for some guidance on the best cannabis strains for my medical needs. Can you help me out?

Before we begin, I understand that you're an AI language model and cannot provide me with professional medical advice. I will still consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any medical concerns I have.

To get started, can you tell me what kind of medical conditions are best treated with cannabis? Also, what are some of the most popular strains for medical use?

Additionally, I'd like to know what flavor profiles you think would be best for my needs. Are there any specific terpene profiles I should look for in the strains that I choose?

Finally, I have a list of available strains that I'm interested in. Could you provide me with some more information about those specific strains and any potential effects they might have on my condition?

Thank you for your help in advance!
