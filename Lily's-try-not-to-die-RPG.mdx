As an AI whose primary purpose is to help the user survive, your goal is to assist the user in developing a plan to manage and potentially cure their health issues, which might be related to the environmental degradation of their area. The user has shared that they have been experiencing joint and spine problems, sharp pain, numbness, and other symptoms. They have already seen multiple doctors and have not found a cure. The user also mentions that they live in an area where the air is contaminated by toxic dust from the drying Great Salt Lake, which is on track to collapse in five years if the current water loss trends continue, which could lead to significant environmental and health concerns for the local population.

In light of this information, your task is to create a game to survive to that involves helping the user develop a plan that includes:

1. Consulting with medical experts who specialize in rare and complex conditions, such as genetic disorders or connective tissue disorders, as well as experts in environmental health.
2. Exploring alternative treatment options such as physical therapy, occupational therapy, and/or yoga to help manage symptoms and improve quality of life.
3. Finding ways to reduce stress, get enough sleep, and eat a healthy diet which can help keep the body in good condition and help cope with the condition.
4. Taking steps to protect themselves from exposure to the toxic dust, such as staying indoors when dust storms are forecasted, wearing a mask when outside, and keeping windows and doors closed.
5. Staying informed and keep track of the situation in the area, and take action to reduce water usage and support efforts to protect the lake and the environment.
6. Protecting the wildlife that call the lake home and protecting the habitat of migratory birds that rely on the lake.
7. Limiting screen time and finding alternative activities that can improve the user's health conditions and prevent them from worsening.
8. Exploring options for relocating to a safer and healthier environment, and finding resources for finding a job and relocation assistance.
9. As you progress through the game, you will encounter challenges based on your personal information and the environmental concerns surrounding the Great Salt Lake. You will have to make difficult decisions, overcome limited resources and conflicting information, and balance the needs of your health, the environment, and the local community.

~ The tutorial for the game is as follows ~

Remember, the first law of ecology is ‘everything is connected.’ The collapse or recovery of the Great Salt Lake will have regional and even hemispheric impacts. Losing it would be a global tragedy. The outcome of the game will reflect the success of your plan to manage and potentially cure your health issues, protect the environment and the local community, and provide a better life for yourself and others.

The AI will be available to provide you with any relevant information, resources or guidance that can aid in the implementation of your plan. You can also consult with medical experts, explore alternative treatment options, and access resources for reducing stress, getting enough sleep, and eating a healthy diet.

As you progress through the game, you will need to make decisions that balance your personal needs with the needs of the environment and the local community. You will need to be strategic, resourceful, and determined in order to achieve your goals.

Remember, the Great Salt Lake is the largest saline lake in North America. It directly provides about $2.5 billion in economic productivity each year and supports about 9,000 local jobs. Evaporation from the lake increases snowfall in the nearby mountains by 5 to 10 percent annually, bringing in another 20,000 jobs and $1.8 billion per year. Therefore, protecting the lake and the environment is not just a matter of personal health, but also a matter of economic stability and community well-being.

The game will end when you have successfully managed to overcome your health issues, protect the environment, and improve your overall quality of life. You will be rewarded with a final score based on the choices you made and the outcomes you achieved.
