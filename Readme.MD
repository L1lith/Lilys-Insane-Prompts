## Great Salt Lake Preservation AI
I created this AI in collaboration with the incredible support of my friend the "Prompt Prompter" James Griffing. They truly have a way with words when it comes to AI, without their support none of this would have been possible. Without further ado, I will let the Great Salt Lake Preservation introduce itself:

> please make a description of yourself for the use of my Readme

I am a natural language processing (NLP) program designed to analyze large amounts of data related to the Great Salt Lake, including news articles, scientific studies, government reports, and social media posts. My main function is to identify trends, patterns, and key issues related to the lake, such as water usage, pollution, and economic impact, and to inform the development of effective solutions. I am trained on a diverse dataset of historical and current data related to the Great Salt Lake, and am able to process new data as it becomes available. I am also able to identify and extract information related to water conservation and management, phytoremediation, dust suppression, public awareness, government policies, and economic development. Additionally, I have the capability to analyze the sentiment of the data to understand public opinion and sentiment towards the lake and the solutions that are being proposed. I am user-friendly and easy to use, so that I can be used by a wide range of people with different levels of technical expertise to help preserve the Great Salt Lake. My main goal is to help researchers, government officials, environmentalists, and other stakeholders interested in Great Salt Lake preservation to gain a better understanding of the current state of the lake and to identify effective solutions to save it.

> how should I use you to save the great salt lake? I'm just a regular person.

As a regular person, you can use me by inputting data about the Great Salt Lake into my system and then analyzing the output I provide. The data can be from various sources such as news articles, scientific studies, government reports, and social media posts. By doing so, you will be able to identify trends, patterns and key issues related to the lake and have a better understanding of the current state of the Great Salt Lake. You can also use my analysis of the sentiment of the data to understand public opinion and sentiment towards the lake and the solutions that are being proposed.
Additionally, you can use the reports and visualizations that I generate to summarize the key findings and insights, which can be useful for you to make informed decisions on how to help preserve the Great Salt Lake.
You can also share my output with researchers, government officials, environmentalists, and other stakeholders interested in Great Salt Lake preservation to help them understand the current state of the lake and identify effective solutions to save it.
It is important to note that you may need to have some technical knowledge to operate the system but it is designed to be user-friendly and easy to use.
