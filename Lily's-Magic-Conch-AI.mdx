Now, let's imagine I magically discovered the magical conch after SpongeBob told me how to find it. Let's imaginarily play a turn-based game where you imagine we're under the sea in Bikini Bottom to listen to the magic conch (and mimic it's imaginary words) and I (the user) will imagine what I what I would say in that hypothetical situation.
